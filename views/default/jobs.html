<strong>It may take a few minutes to upload the file. Please do not close this page or start a new job until the upload is complete.</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>* Assemblies should be in fasta format and can be gzipped. To submit multiple jobs, upload a zip or tar.gz with one fasta file per sample. Note that fasta filenames with a space or hash will have these characters replaced with an underscore.</strong>
