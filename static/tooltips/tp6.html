<div>tBLASTn matches to genes from other K-locus references that were found outside the K-locus region of your assembly.</div>
<div>Several of the K-locus genes are homologous to genes found in other locations in the genome e.g. the <i>rml</i> or <i>man</i> genes. It is very common for <i>Kaptive</i> to find a small number of ‘other’ K-locus genes outside the K-locus region of the assembly. These are not a cause for concern and do not negatively impact the confidence of a K-locus match. However, if <i>Kaptive</i> finds a large number of genes (more than 5 or 6) the results should be treated cautiously.</div>
