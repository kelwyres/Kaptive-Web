<div>Indicates how good is the match to the best-matching locus.</div>
<div><strong>Perfect:</strong> The locus region in your assembly is in one piece and has 100% coverage plus 100% nucleotide identity to the reference locus. </div>
<div><strong>Very high:</strong> The locus region in your assembly is in one piece and has ≥99% coverage to the reference locus, with no expected genes missing and no unexpected locus genes.</div>
<div><strong>High:</strong> The locus region in your assembly is in one piece and has ≥95% coverage to the reference locus, with ≤3 expected genes missing and no unexpected locus genes. </div>
<div><strong>Good:</strong> The locus region in your assembly is in one piece <i>OR</i> has ≥95% coverage to the reference locus, with ≤3 expected genes missing and ≤1 unexpected locus genes.</div>
<div><strong>Low:</strong> The locus region in your assembly is in one piece <i>OR</i> has ≥90% coverage to the reference locus, with ≤3 expected genes missing and ≤2 unexpected locus genes.</div>
<div><strong>None:</strong> The locus region of your assembly does not meet the above criteria.</div>
<div><strong>Expected gene</strong> = a gene in the best-match locus</div>
<div><strong>Unexpected gene</strong> = a gene from another locus</div>
