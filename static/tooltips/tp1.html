    <li>Indicates how good is the match to the best-matching locus.</li>
    <li><strong>Perfect:</strong> The K-locus region in your assembly is in one piece and has 100% coverage plus 100% nucleotide identity to the reference locus. </li>
    <li><strong>Very high:</strong> The K-locus region in your assembly is in one piece and has ≥99% coverage to the reference locus, with no expected genes missing and no unexpected K-locus genes.</li>
    <li><strong>High:</strong> The K-locus region in your assembly is in one piece and has ≥95% coverage to the reference locus, with ≤3 expected genes missing and no unexpected K-locus genes. </li>
    <li><strong>Good:</strong> The K-locus region in your assembly is in one piece <i>OR</i> has ≥95% coverage to the reference locus, with ≤3 expected genes missing and ≤1 unexpected K-locus genes.</li>
    <li><strong>Low:</strong> The K-locus region in your assembly is in one piece <i>OR</i> has ≥90% coverage to the reference locus, with ≤3 expected genes missing and ≤2 unexpected K-locus genes.</li>
    <li><strong>None:</strong> The K-locus region of your assembly does not meet the above criteria.</li>
    <li><strong>Expected gene</strong> = a gene in the best-match locus</li>
    <li><strong>Unexpected gene</strong> = a gene from another K-locus</li>
