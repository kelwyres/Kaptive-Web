<ul>
    <li>The difference between the length of the best-matching reference K-locus and the K-locus region of your assembly, in base pairs. A positive value indicates that your assembly’s K-locus is longer than the reference sequence. A negative value indicates it is shorter than the reference.</li>
    <li>This value is only applicable when the K-locus is present in a single assembly piece (it will be ‘n/a’ when there are two or more assembly pieces).</li>
